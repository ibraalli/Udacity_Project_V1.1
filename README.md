# Analyzing Developer Trends Across Continents with Stack Overflow Survey Data 2017
# Used Libraries
This Python project enhances its CRISP DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) functionality by integrating NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Utilizing NumPy for numerical tasks, Pandas for managing structured data, Matplotlib for visual representation, and Seaborn for advanced statistical graphics, the project systematically examines a dataset. The workflow encompasses data loading, cleaning, and insightful visualizations, offering a thorough comprehension of patterns and trends. The amalgamation of these libraries streamlines and fortifies the CRISP DM process, ultimately aiding in well-informed decision-making
# Used Data Stack Overflow Survey 2017
The Stack Overflow Survey 2017 dataset is a comprehensive collection of responses from the Stack Overflow annual developer survey conducted in 2017. This dataset encompasses a wide range of information related to software developers, their demographics, professional backgrounds, preferences, and opinion
